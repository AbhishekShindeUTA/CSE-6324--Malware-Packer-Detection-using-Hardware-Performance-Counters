# CSE-6324--Malware-Packer-Detection-using-Hardware-Performance-Counters
Identifying Malware Packing Algorithms using Hardware Performance Counters.


In order to run Extractor.py you will need to have python installed on your system as well as pandas.
This program is meant to be a part of the tool and should not be used itself by the user.

***About Me***
This tool is meant to classify between a program packed with UCL, LZMA, or neither. Currently, testing and accuracy has only be performend on the Intel processor Sandybridge for I3. 

UCL is an algorithm used as a portable lossless data compression library. More information can be found https://github.com/AbhishekShindeUTA/CSE-6324--Malware-Packer-Detection-using-Hardware-Performance-Counters

LZMA is another algorithm used as a lossless data compression library most commonly found in the packer 7zip. More information and details can be found here.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm


This program is currently in research and development.
